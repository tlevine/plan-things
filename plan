USAGE="
Plan things, in a kind-of-xtreme way. Plans get saved in the
~/.plans directory, which you can version nicely in git.

USAGE: $0 show GROUP
       $0 move [thing id] GROUP
       $0 edit [thing id] [[task id]]
       $0 help

GROUP is one of the following.

  proposed
  current
  passed
  done

plan show: List the things and tasks in a group.
  In addition to the four groups above, you can
  specify "all", which will list all the things.

plan move: Move a thing to a different group.

plan help: Show this help.

plan edit: Edit the description of a story or task
           and the estimated duration of a task.

# If you ran plan (rather than sourcing it).

  case $(input_command $1) in
    other) echo "$USAGE" && exit 1 ;;
    help)  echo "$USAGE" ;;
    edit)  echo edit  ;;
    move)  echo move  ;;
